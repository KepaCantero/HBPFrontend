  <h2>Environment Designer</h2>
  <h4><span class="label label-warning">The Environment Designer development will start soon.</span></h4>

  <p>The Environment Designer will allow users to design virtual environments for interactions with simulated robots in
    the context of virtual experiments. The user can either refer to a library of pre-build parts and design primitives,
    or design new objects by specifying their appearance and their physical properties.</p>
  <h4>Meanwhile...</h4>

  <p>The neurorobotics platform is built on top of <a href="http://gazebosim.org/">Gazebo</a> <img
    src="img/common/gazebo-logo.png"/>. Any environment created for Gazebo (and made of simple primitive or Collada
    objects) is therefore compatible with the platform. Gazebo uses the SDF format. If you want your environments to be
    available, you need to upload the corresponding SDF file(s) and assets through the portal document browser (<img
      src="img/common/document-browser.png" alt="Document browser"/>). In order for it to be recognised by the platform,
    the
    main sdf file needs to be edited:
  <ul>
    <li>The content type should be changed to <b>nrp/environment</b></li>
    <li>A custom attribute <b>nrpDescription</b> with a string containing the description of the environment needs to be
      added.
    </li>
    <li>A custom attribute <b>nrpName</b> with a string containing the name of the environment needs to be added,</li>
    <li>An optional attribute <b>thumbnail</b> with the uuid to an image uploaded to the portal representing the
      environment can be added.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
