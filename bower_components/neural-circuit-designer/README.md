# Neural Circuit Designer (NCD)
*Design and create neural circuits with ease!*

This program started as an intern project at the
[Blue Brain Project](http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/).
It is used in the platform of the
[Human Brain Project](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/) which unfortunately is
not yet open source.
During development I decided to turn it into an angular directive so that both I
can keep working on it and everybody can use it.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the directive and add dependency to bower.json
```shell
bower install --save swenzel/neural-circuit-designer
```

### Usage

```html
<ncd-app blueprint='blueprint' pynnscript='pynnscript'></ncd-app>
```

`blueprint` and `pynnscript` have to be bound to scope variables.
The former one will be the js object representing the blueprint.json which will
be edited by the NCD.

The latter one will be the variable where the NCD stores the
[PyNN](http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/)-script as a string.
This script will be generated by the NCD on demand using the blueprint.

The controller providing these scope variables has to deal with loading and/or
saving them on change.

## Creating Neuronal Nets

App is not yet functional. But in order to get some impressions what it may
be like in the future, see
[this presentation](http://slides.com/swenwenzel/neural-circuit-designer) which
I gave during a workshop in Geneva.
